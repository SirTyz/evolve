A start at messing with genetic algorithms.


Inspired to try my hand at creating a genetic algorithm to imitate the existance of a population over time with the chance of having mutations. 

[This article is](https://medium.com/sigmoid/https-medium-com-rishabh-anand-on-the-origin-of-genetic-algorithms-fc927d2e11e0) what helped me get a grasp on where I needed to start. I also got inspiration from watching [Primer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKzJFdi57J53Vr_BkTfN3uQ).
